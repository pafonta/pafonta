### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Senior Research Engineer** with 8 years' experience, a growth mindset, and a passion for **Natural Language Understanding** with Self-Supervised Learning. Both independently and in teams, I have been working on **extracting, exploring, and analyzing** information and **knowledge** from texts and **scientific literatur**e. A great motivation for me is to do so with committed people and building upon **state-of-the-art research** and **cutting-edge Python technologies**. I hold a Master of Science in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Engineering** from a French 'Grande Ã‰cole' (2013).
